# Malaria-Disease-Detection
The Model detects wheather given image is infected by a parasite or not.

# Problem Statement

The problem is to detect wheather a given image of a cell is infected by parasite or not, if we can make a machine learning model then we can save humans by detecting and deploying Image Cells that contain Malaria or not!

# Dataset

The Dataset is taken from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria. The dataset contains thousands of images of both the categories with malaria and without malaria, thus the model should have a good accuracy.
The Dataset is quite large thus it cannot be uploaded to Github.

# Technology used

For this problem we will be using Transfer Learning with ImageDataGenerator. Generally VGG16 and VGG19 gives the best accuracy, so here we will be using VGG16

# Webapp

Please find the link to webapp for this project
The model saved file is quite large, thus cannot be uploaded to GitHub

# How to use Webapp

Click on Upload image
Download images given in this github page, with names Test1p.png, Test2p.png etc
Upload these images to webapp
Check the result

# Conclusion

The model gives approximately 90% accuracy which is a good accuracy for this kind of problem, thus the model is successful.
